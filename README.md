# panoramas
Image stitching to create panoramas. Done in 2 different ways -
1. Using Homography to transfer all images to same plane and stiching them.
2. Using Cylindrical method warp images on an imaginary cylinder and stitch them.

In both the methods, produce results with and without Laplacian Pyramid blending.
